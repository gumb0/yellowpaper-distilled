      - difficulty
        - Can be calculated from the previous block's difficulty and timestamp
          - difficulty of genesis block = 131072
          - x = floor(parent block difficulty / 2048)
          - before homestead: c = 1 if timestamp < parent timestamp + 13, c = -1 otherwise
          - homestead: c = max(1 - floor((timestamp - parent timestamp) / 10), -99)
          - byzantium: c = max(2 if parent has uncles else 1 - floor((timestamp - parent timestamp) / 9), -99)
            - This change makes difficulty adjustment proportional to ETH issued & hashpower spent on the block, instead of just proportional to timestamp change, which prevents attack vectors with manipulating uncle rate to game the system
          - epsilon = floor(2**(floor(block number / 1e5) - 2))
          - difficulty = max(genesis difficulty, parent difficulty + x * c + epsilon)
        - This mechanism enforces a homeostasis in terms of the time between blocks; a smaller period between the last two blocks results in an increase in the difficulty level and thus additional computation required, lengthening the likely next period. Conversely, if the period is too large, the difficulty, and expected time to the next block, is reduced.
        - The expected time to find the nonce & mixHash is proportional to the difficulty

- Transaction execution
  - Check for validity
    - The transaction is well-formed RLP, with no additional trailing bytes
    - Signature is valid
    - Nonce = sender's current nonce
    - gasLimit >= the intrinsic gas, g0, used by the transaction (see below)
    - sender balance contains at least the cost, v0, required in up-front payment (see below)
  - Substate - info that is acted upon immediately following the transaction
    - Suicide set
      - set of accounts that will be discarded following the transaction's completion
    - Log series
      - a series of archived and indexable `checkpoints' in VM code execution that allow for contract-calls to be easily tracked by onlookers external to the Ethereum world (such as decentralised application front-ends)
      - Append-only, not readable by contracts
      - ~10x cheaper  than storage
      - organized into Merkle trie which allows efficient light client access to event records
    - Touched accounts
      - Empty ones are deleted at the end of transaction
    - Refund balance
      - increased through using the SSTORE instruction in order to reset contract storage to zero from some non-zero value
  - Execution
    - Intrinsic gas - the amount of gas this transaction requires to be paid prior to execution
      - for input data/new contract init code G(txdatazero) for zero byte + G(txdatanonzero) for each next byte
      - + G(txcreate) for contract creation after Homestead
      - + G(transaction)
    - Up-front cost = gasPrice * gasLimit + transferValue
    - Validity
      - Sender can be calculated from signature
      - Sender exists
      - Transaction nonce equals sender nonce
      - Intrinsic gas <= gasLimit
      - up-front cost <= sender balance
      - gasLimit + gas used already in this block <= block gasLimit
    - Execution
      - Increment nonce of sender
      - sender balance -= gasLimit * gasPrice
      - gasLeft = gasLimit - intrinsicGas
      - This moment is called checkpoint state
      - Contract creation
        - New account
          - Address = rightmost 160 bits of Keccac hash of RLP(sender, sender nonce - 1) // decrementing nonce assuming it was already incremented; we need nonce at the beginning of transaction here
          - nonce = 1
          - balance = transferred vlaue + previous balance if account already existed
          - Storage is empty
          - Code hash = Keccak256(empty string)
        - Reduce sender's balance by the value passed
        - Execute initialization code
          - If it runs out of gas, OOG exception occurs and the entire create operation should have no effect on the state, effectively leaving it as it was immediately prior to attempting the creation.
            - intrinsic cost is still paid, gasLeft = 0 after it
            - transferred value is not paid
          - Subtleties
            - During this execution newly created account exists but without code. So any message received by it doesn't execute any code.
            - If the initialisation execution ends with a SUICIDE instruction, the matter is moot since the account will be deleted before the transaction is completed.
            - For a normal STOP code, or if the code returned is otherwise empty, then the state is left with a zombie account, and any remaining balance will be locked into the account forever.
        - Final contract creation cost is paid = 2**256 - 1 if created contract's code size <= 24000, otherwise G(codedesposit) * code size 
          - (that is, subtracted from gasLeft)
          - This can also run out of gas resulting in OOG
          - Before Homestead in case of OOG here account is still created, along with initialization side-effects and the value is transferred, but no contract code is deployed. gasLeft stays the same then.
        - Save code returned from initialization code as new contract's code
      - Message call
        - Transfer value from sender to recipent
          - If recipient doesn't exist and transferred value is not zero, create it first with no code, no state, zero balance and zero nonce
        - Execute account's code
          - If exception occurs (OOG, stack underflow, invalid jump destination, invalid instruction), no gas is refunded to the caller and the state is reverted to the point immediately prior to balance transfer (so the gas fee still goes to rhe miner and value transfer is reverted)
          - Precompiled contracts
            - Four contracts which don't invoke EVM execution (i.e. implemented natively)
            - address = 1 - ECREC (elliptic curve public key recovery function)
            - address = 2 - SHA256 
            - address = 3 - RIP160 (RIPEMD 160-bit hash scheme)
            - address = 4 - ID (identity function)
              -  output equals input
            - address = 5 - MODEXP (modular exponentiation (base**exp) % mod) // since Byzantium
            - address = 6 - ECADD (elliptic curve point addition) // since Byzantium
            - address = 7 - ECMUL (elliptic curve point scalar multiplication)// since Byzantium
            - address = 8 - ECPAIR // since Byzantium
            - address = 9 - BLAKE2b // since Istanbul
    - Finalization

      - Delete all accounts that either appear in the suicide list or are touched and empty
- EVM
  - stack-based architecture
  - Word size, stack item size = 256 bit (32 bytes)
  - Maximum stack size is 1024
  - Memory - word-addressed byte array. Volatile
  - Storage - word-addressable word array. Non-volatile, maintained as a part of the system state.
  - All locations in memory and storage are initially zero
  - Program code is not stored in memory, instead it is stored in a virtual ROM accessible only through special instruction
  - Integers are big-endian
  - 160-bit address is stored in rightwards (least significant) bits of 256-bit words
  - Gas paid for the operation (before operation execution)
    - Intrinsic operation cost
    - Payment for the subordinate message call or contract creation (in case of CREATE, CALL & CALLCODE instructions)
    - Payment for the usage of the memory
      - Over an account's execution, the total fee for memory usage payable is proportional to smallest multiple of 32 bytes that are required such that all memory indices (whether for read or write) are included in the range
      - When storage value is cleared, refund is given
  - Machine state
    - gas available
    - program counter PC - 256 bit
    - Memory contents
    - Active number of words in memory
    - Stack contents
  - Exception happens when
    - There's insufficient gas for the next instruction
    - instruction is invalid
    - There's insufficient items in stack for instruction
    - JUMP/JUMPI destination is invalid
      - Destination should be any position in code occupied by JUMPDEST instruction
      - All such positions must be on valid instruction boundaries, rather than sitting in the data portion of PUSH operations and must appear within the explicitly defined portion of the code (rather than in the implicitly defined STOP operations that trail it)
    - New stack size is going to be more than 1024
  - Program halts when
    - after RETURN instruction with result given by return
    - after STOP, SUICIDE instructions with result ()
  - Execution cycle
    - Stack items are added or removed from the left-most, lower-indexed portion of the series
    - Gas is reduced by instruction cost
    - PC increments, unless it's JUMP or JUMPI
  - Operation cost
    - G_memory paid for each word of memory accessed expansion
    - After 724 bytes of memory used it costs quadratically

        - first - gas we provide to this execution
        - second - receiver account address
        - third - transfer value
        - fourth and fifth - memory address and size of input data
        - sixth and seventh -  memory address and size of output data
        - pushes 0 if execution failed with exception, if balance is not enough to transfer value, or if current depth of contract creation / message calls reached 1024
        - pushes 1 if success
      - CALLCODE - message-call into this account with alternative account's code
        - call code of another account but with this same account as recipient
        - parameters the same as for CALL
        - DELEGATECALL was added in Homestead to fix not preserving sender and value
          - CALLCODE sets sender to called account
          - DELEGATECALL sets sender to this account
          - http://ethereum.stackexchange.com/questions/3667/difference-between-call-callcode-and-delegatecall
      - RETURN - halt execution and return output data
        - pops 2 values - memory address and size of output data
      - DELEGATECALL - message-call into this account with alternative account's code, but persisting the current values for sender and value // since Homestead
        - pops 6 values
        - parameters the same as for CALL but transfer value is skipped
        - recipient is the same account as this, just the code is overwritten and context is almost identical (apart from gas and depth)
      - SUICIDE - halt the execution and register account for later deletion
        - pops account address to send remaining funds to
        - Refund is given to account if it's not yet in suicide list
        - #TODO gas cost not clear
      - REVERT - stop execution and return error without consuming all remaining gas // Since Byzantium
      - STATICCALL - call with a guarantee that the state is not modified, read-only call // since Byzantium

  - Seed is computed for each block
    - Seed is 32 bytes
    - Different for every epoch
    - For the first epoch  = Keccak256(32 bytes of zeros)
    - For next epochs = Kecc356(previous seed)
  - Compute pseudorandom cache from the seed
    - Sequentially fill cacheSize bytes of memory
      - First 64 bytes = KEC512(seed)
      - Each next 64 bytes = KEC512(prev)
    - J(cacherounds) = 3 passes of RandMemoHash algorithm
  - From the cache generate a dataset with the property that each item in the dataset depends on only a small number of items from the cache
    - light clients don't store the whole dataset, only cache
    - Essentially, we combine data from J(parents)=256 pseudorandomly selected cache nodes, and hash that to compute the dataset
    - The entire dataset is then generated by a number of items, each 64 bytes in size
    - In order to calculate the single item we use an algorithm inspired by the FNV hash in some cases as a non-associative substitute for XOR
  - Dataset grows linearly with time
  - Mining - grab random slices of the dataset and hash them together
    - Essentially, we maintain a "mix" J(mixbytes) = 128 bytes wide, and repeatedly sequentially fetch 128 bytes from the full dataset and use the FNV function to combine it with the mix
    - 128 bytes of sequential access are used so that each round of the algorithm always fetches a full page from RAM
    - If the output of this algorithm is below the desired target, then the nonce is valid
  - Verification can regenerate only the specific pieces of dataset from the cache
  - Dataset is updated once every epoch = 30000 blocks, grows every time
  - In order to avoid regularity leading to cyclic behavior, the dataset and cache sizes must be prime numbers

- RLP
  - Integer
    - RLP(big endian representation of integer)
  - Byte array
    - If one byte with value < 128, return this one value
    - If size < 56 bytes, return sequence [128 + size, bytes]
    - If size >= 56 bytes, return [183 + size of encoded length, big-endian integer length, bytes]
  - List
    - if total size < 56 bytes, [192 + total size, serialized items]
    - If size >= 56 bytes, return [247 + size of encoded length, big-endian integer length, serialized items]
- Merkle Patricia Tree
  - Allow efficient (logarithmic) insert/delete operations
  - Hex-prefix encoding
    - Encodes sequence of hex nibbles + a flag to a sequence of bytes
    - High nibble of the first byte contains two flags
      - the lowest bit encodes the oddness of sequence length
      - the second-lowest encodes the input flag
    - If number of nibbles is even low nibble of first byte is zero, data starts with second byte
    - If number of nibbles is odd data starts with low nibble of first byte 
  - Maps from 256-bit hashes to arbitrary-length binary data
  - If node's RLP encoding is < 32 bytes it is stored directly, otherwise it stores hash-pointer to byte array
  - Three kinds of nodes
    - Leaf
      - RLP(HP-encoded(remaining nibbles of key), true), value)
    - Extension
      - RLP(HP-encoded(2 (?) next nibbles of key), false), pointer to next node)
    - Branch
      - RLP(child0, ..., child15, value or () if no value for this prefix)

- Signing transactions
  - Private key - random positive integer 32 bytes long, big-endian in the range [1, sec256k1n - 1]
  - Public key - byte array of size 64 formed from the concatenation of two positive   integers each < 2**256
  - ECDSASIGN(e, private key) = (v, r, s)
  - Message to sign is the Keccak hash of the transaction fields
  - Validation
    - 0 < r < secp256k1n
    - 0  < s < secp2561kn before Homestead
    - 0 < s < sep256k1n / 2 after Homestead
    - v - either the 'recovery id' (27 or 28, specifies sign of the curve point) or 'chain id doubled plus 35 or 36'
  - #TODO not all clear, elliptic curve crypto is magic
