# Yellow Paper Distilled

<div><img src="./assets/tequila.jpg" height="150px"/></div>

Easy to read notes on Ethereum "Yellow Paper".

These are markdown notes for quick reference based on ["Yellow Paper" specification](https://github.com/ethereum/yellowpaper), originally by Gavin Wood.

Not intended to be a thorough specification replacing Yellow Paper, but rather a semi-formal summary of the spec.

I don't recommend to read it from top to the bottom, but rather search occasionally for the section you want to consult.

It originated from [yellowpaper-outline](https://github.com/gumb0/yellowpaper-outline) project, where I tried to maintain these notes in another format for easy import into some proprietary tools.
